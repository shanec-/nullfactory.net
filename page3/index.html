		<p><em>Bad things may happen when you power up a virtualized Domain Controller on your laptop and connect it to the corporate network.</em></p>

<p>This post focuses on building a self-contained, isolated virtual environment with internet connectivity.</p>

<p>My colleague, Chaminda has a <a href="http://chamindac.blogspot.com/2013/12/setup-virtual-environment-for-tfs-2013_19.html">detailed post</a> on how to setup and isolated environment using virtual box. Go check it out if you would like to implement it via virtual box.  While virtual box is a good virtualization platform on its own right, I have grown accustomed to using Hyper-V in my day-job and has become a personal preference.</p>

<h2>Hyper-V</h2>

<p>My own environment is built around this <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/askpfeplat/archive/2013/03/04/your-personal-isolated-lab-featuring-windows-8-hyper-v.aspx">excellent post</a>. It details the entire process involved. While my own setup is identical to the above, I have taken into account the following caveats:</p>

<ol>
<li>As mentioned by one of the comments on the post, it is important to explicitly set the port to <code>eth0</code> soon after flashing the image.</li>
<li><p>Port Forwarding - Even simple tasks like setting up share folders require that certain ports be accessible. Therefore this it is an important consideration when planning an isolated environment. Here are some of the services and ports I've used for my TFS environment:</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/IsolatedEnvironment/1_PortForwarding.png" alt="Port Forwarding" /></p></li>
</ol>

<h3>Setting up Routing</h3>

<p>Even though I have my isolated environment, there are instances where I would like resource in my main network to have access to the internal network. Although port forwarding works to a certain degree, we run into its limitations very fast.</p>

<p>This involves setting up routes on both out internal router as well as the external router under which the external resources exists.</p>

		<p>It's been a while since I've have had the opportunity to write any powershell. So I decided to do something before my muscle memory atrophies completely.</p>

<p>While I could not come up with a new problem to solve, I decided to re-visit my attempt at extracting the direct download url from a streaming service.I believe this is my 3rd attempt and its fast becoming my version of a "hello world" application. :)</p>

<p>Previously, I tried to implement and parse out the urls by myself. This version is not going to be as complex as I will be using the <a href="http://www.keepvid.com">keepvid.com</a> to do the heavy lifting.</p>

		<p>Application Lifecycle Management is an area that I have been wanting to improve for a while now. And what better way to do it than getting my self certified in the Microsoft ALM exams. I have decided to create a series of posts dedicated to ALM and sort of my "Road to Certification" posts.</p>

<p>In this post, I provide an overview of the different accounts that are required for the installation and smooth operation of TFS.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>I created this mind map that graphically illustrates the accounts and required permissions by the different services in order to help me remember all the dependencies.</p>

<p><a href="/images/posts/TFSServiceAccounts/0_TFSAccountsOveriew.png"><img src="/images/posts/TFSServiceAccounts/0_TFSAccountsOveriew.png" alt="TFS Accounts Overview" /></a></p>

<p>While the majority of production installations would be deployed in a multi-tiered environment, I would normally assume that all of the accounts listed above are part of the same domain (with the exception of <code>DEPLOY</code> account. I will discuss cross domain considerations in a different post).</p>

<p>While I will go into detail in future posts, but for the initial installation the following accounts are required:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>TFSInstall</code> - An installation account that would automatically be added as a TFS Administrator</li>
<li><code>TFSService</code> - Used to run the Team Foundation Service</li>
<li><code>TFSReports</code> - Used to run the SQL Server Reporting Service (SSRS)</li>
</ul>

		<p>I have been meaning to do this for a while and now finally got around to cleaning up and publishing the source. This was the first Windows Phone app that I actually saw through to completion and was pretty proud of it at the time. You can find the original posts <a href="http://nullfactory.blogspot.com/2012/04/bookmark-organizer-01-for-windows-phone.html">here</a> and <a href="http://nullfactory.blogspot.com/2012/05/bookmark-organizer-02-with-skydrive.html">here</a>  </p>

<p>Although the popularity of the 7.x branch is on the decline, I hope someone would have use for it.</p>

<p>The project is now distributed via <a href="https://github.com/shanec-/Nullfactory.BookmarkSync">Github</a>. Enjoy!</p>
