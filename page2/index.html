		<p>I was attempting to diagnose and issue for a client the other day. It revolves around a single workflow that is being executed on both the create and update event of a field. And within this workflow, a custom activity executed if the field matches a certain condition. The problem was that the custom activity was being executed twice when it was only expected to run once.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/AsyncWorkflow/10_singleworkflow.png" alt="Single Workflow" /> </p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/AsyncWorkflow/20_singleworkflow_trigger.png" alt="Workflow Triggger" /></p>

<p>If we take the above example, it can be replicated easily:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a new record where <code>Delivery Status</code> is <code>Current</code>.</li>
<li>Immediately update the record to <code>Pending</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Navigate to the background processes and ensure that the workflow was executed twice, once on the create and then again on the update. If you performed the update soon enough, you notice that both instances satisfied the citieria and the custom activity invoked.</p>

<p>This behaviour is by design - when an async workflow is triggered it neither guarantees the immediate execution of the process nor the state of the record at the time it was queued. This means that the workflow would work against the latest version of the record at the time of execution.</p>

		<p>A continuous integration build ensures that the code within a source control repository can be compiled successfully after a commit. <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/continuous-integration">It is defined as</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that requires developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Where as CI builds occur after a commit has been merged into the repository, a gated check-in is a "pessimistic" process that would treat a commit as completed <strong>only</strong> if the result of it being merged with the repository is a successful build.</p>

<p>In this post I will try my hand in setting up a gated check-in using Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS). I will start off with TFSVC as the underlying version control system and then replicate the same functionality using Git.</p>

		<p>My colleagues and I ran into a interesting problem the other day; we noticed that on some records all the notes attached to it were being updated seemingly randomly being updated. At first glance I was confused as to why this was happening, but we eventually found the steps to reproduce it: </p>

<ol>
<li>Create a record <code>Record 1</code> in an entity. This can either be a custom entity or out-of-the-box entity with notes and attachments enabled. </li>
<li>If the notes control has not been added onto the form, do that now.</li>
<li>Update it such that it has several notes created by different users.</li>
<li>Next make sure that <code>Record 1</code> is owned by <code>User A</code>.</li>
<li>Login as <code>User B</code> and reassign the <code>Record 1</code> to <code>User C</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, if we observe the notes control it shows <code>User B</code>'s name along side the date and time stamp. </p>

<p>I was initially thrown off as to why the above actions changed the <code>Created By</code> of the notes, but what I failed to realize was that the annotation control shows the <code>Modified By</code> user and not the <code>Created By</code>.</p>

      <p>
		
		<p>In past projects my release note strategy has been a combination of custom scripts (to pull the changesets between releases) and good old fashioned elbow grease to manually create the notes. I was curious to know ways about the ways to achieve the same in git and learning about the techniques used in popular open source projects.  </p>

<p>In order to automatically generate a changelog the repository requires consistent commits - and I found that there are three steps that can be done to achieve this: </p>

<ol>
<li>Enforcing commit message rules.</li>
<li>Install and setup tools that help generate commit messages that are compliant.</li>
<li>Generate the changelog for the project based on the commits.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<ul>
<li>Node.js - instructions on installing node can be found <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node">here</a>.</li>
<li>A <code>package.json</code> file for your project. One can be generated by navigating to the root folder of the project, run the <code>npm init</code> command and follow the instructions</li>
</ul>

<h2>Enforcing Commit Message Rules</h2>

<p>The enforcing of the rules are done using <code>husky</code> and <code>validate-commit-msg</code> packages. <code>Husky</code> makes it very easy to tap into the commit event and execute custom validation scripts and uses <a href="https://tygertec.com/git-hooks-practical-uses-windows/">git hooks</a> to do this. <code>validate-commit-msg</code> implements the validation scheme - conventional commits - that we would be used when the commit occurs.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://conventionalcommits.org/">conventional commits specification site</a> summarizes its advantages very well:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Automatically generating CHANGELOGs.</li>
  <li>Automatically determining a semantic version bump (based on the types of commits landed).</li>
  <li>Communicating the nature of changes to teammates, the public, and other stakeholders.</li>
  <li>Triggering build and publish processes.</li>
  <li>Making it easier for people to contribute to your projects, by allowing them to explore a more structured commit history.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

		<p>In this third and final installment I cover the steps involved in setting up the minimum release and deployment steps required for a successful Dynamics CRM/365 deployment. The steps and actions performed in the previous posts acts as prerequisites for this one.</p>

<h2>The Packages</h2>

<p>In the <a href="/2017/04/deploy-dynamics-crm-solutions-vsts-octopus-deploy-build-part-2/">previous post</a>, I setup the team build to automatically publish packages into the Octopus Deploy package repository. </p>

<p>We can verify that they have indeed been published by navigating to the <code>Library &gt; Packages</code> tab for a list of available packages.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/OctoDeployPt3/05_published_package.png" alt="Available Packages" /> </p>

<h2>Defining the Environment</h2>

<p>Environments are a logical grouping of targets / machines used by deployments. For the purpose of this post, I will create one environment - <code>Testing</code> and it would contain a single CRM deployment target - the CRM Server). </p>

<ol>
<li>Let's start off by clicking on the <code>Environments</code> from the main menu to navigate to the environment configuration page.</li>
<li>Click on <code>Add environment</code> in the resulting page.</li>
<li><p>Set <code>Testing</code> as the name of the environment .</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/OctoDeployPt3/10_create_environment.png" alt="Existing Build Definition" /></p></li>
<li>Click on <code>Save</code> to confirm selection.</li>
</ol>

		<p>This is the second part of a series of posts where I attempt to deploy a Dynamics 365/CRM solution using Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) and Octopus Deploy (OD). Previously, I setup an OD server and integrated it with VSTS - the steps describe in that post act as a prerequisite for this one. In this post we go about modifying an existing Dynamics CRM build definition to automatically package the release-artifact and upload it to the OD server for deployment. </p>

</ul>

<h2>Publishing Packages</h2>

<p>There are a few different ways of getting a package into Octopus Deploy:</p>

<ul>
<li>Remotely upload a package to Octopus Deploy's built-in repository.</li>
<li>Make octopus deploy pull packages from an external feed. Find more information <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/package/overview">here</a> on setting up VSTS to publish an package feed.</li>
<li>Manually upload the package into the built-in repository.</li>
</ul>

<p>And the method of publishing the package has no bearing on the end deployment -I chose to explicitly push to the remote octopus deploy server. </p>

		<p>I have seen <a href="https://octopus.com/">Octopus Deploy (OD)</a> being mentioned frequently in the community but haven't had a chance to play around with it myself. Therefore, I think that attempting to deploy a Dynamics 365/CRM solution using Octopus Deploy seemed like the perfect exercise to learn more about the platform and its features.</p>

<p>I was curious if there were other developers who have released Dynamics CRM using Octopus Deploy and sure enough there was some one who had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--9u5azwSb4">already thought of that</a>.</p>

<p>In this series of posts I try to cover everything from setting up integration with Visual Studio Team Services(VSTS), updating a build definition to automatically publish itself and then finally setting up a simple release and deployment pipeline.</p>

<p>Related posts from the series:</p>

<li><a href="/2017/04/deploy-dynamics-crm-solutions-vsts-octopus-deploy-release-part-3/">Deploy Dynamics CRM Solutions using VSTS and Octopus Deploy - Part 3 - Release and Deployment</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<ul>
<li>Project structure and deployment scripts based on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-nullfactory-xrm">generator-nullfactory-xrm</a> (with a minimum version of at least 1.4.0). <a href="/2016/10/release-strategy-for-dynamics-crm-prepping-part-1/">Read More</a></li>
<li>The project checked into Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) using either <code>git</code> or <code>tfsvc</code> with a working team build already setup. <a href="/2016/11/release-strategy-for-dynamics-crm-setting-up-the-build-part-2">Read More</a>.</li>
<li>Installation of Octopus Deploy and ensure sure that it is publicly accessible. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0BQvMDXPNQ">Read More</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Strategy</h2>

<p>When I saw the integration tasks provided by the OD extensions for VSTS, my first reaction was to divide the tasks between the build and the release in VSTS. I wanted to the the build definition to build and package the solution and pass it on to release management. Release management would then publishing the release-artifact to OD and explicitly remote trigger the OD deployment.</p>

<p>While it was certainly possible to set this up, its did not make sense to have two deployment services for the same pipeline. Therefore the strategy is going to be very similar to the one that I had done previously - VSTS would continue to act as the version control and build server but this time Octopus deploy would act as the release component.</p>

<p>The build server would handle creating compatible package and uploading it to the OD package repository. And OD takes over the management of the environment, release and deployment complexities.</p>

		<p>More often than not the custom Dynamics 365 solutions I develop depend on third party solutions to provide additional functionality. Therefore these solutions become a pre-requisite to the successful deployment of my own solution. </p>

<p>In this post I go about updating the <a href="/2016/10/release-strategy-for-dynamics-crm-prepping-part-1/">previously setup project</a>, <a href="/2016/11/release-strategy-for-dynamics-crm-setting-up-the-build-part-2">build</a> and <a href="/2016/11/release-strategy-for-dynamics-crm-setting-up-the-release-part-3/">release</a> definitions in Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) in order to enable deployment of third party CRM solutions.</p>

<h2>Pre-requisites</h2>

<ul>
<li>Project structure and deployment scripts based on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-nullfactory-xrm">generator-nullfactory-xrm</a> (with a minimum version of at least 1.4.0).</li>

		<p>My colleagues and I ran into this confusing issue the other day. We've been working on a Dynamics 365 Online instance integrated with SharePoint (as a server side configuration) and everything seem to be working as expected but for a few records. On these records, anytime the user hits the upload button in document management they are greeted with the following error message instead of the expected upload dialog:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>An error has occurred. </p>
  
  <p>Try this action again. If the problem continues, check the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Community for solutions or contact your organization's Microsoft Dynamics 365 Administrator. Finally, you can contact Microsoft Support.</p>
