This post is the second in a three part series of posts that walk you through setting up a release management strategy for Dynamics CRM.
To re-cap the first part of the previous post we have:
	1. Setup the project structure using the `nullfactory-xrm` generator.
	2. Downloaded the CRM solution from the remote server and unpacked it using the solution packager tool.
	3. Checked-in all the artifacts back into source control.

1. Navigate to the `Build and Release` > `Builds`
