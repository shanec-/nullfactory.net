title: Bookmarks Organizer Source Published
category: Mobile Development, Windows Phone

I have been meaning to do this for a while and now finally got around to cleaning up and publishing the source. This was the first Windows Phone app that I actually saw through to completion and was pretty proud of it at the time. You can find the original posts [here](http://nullfactory.blogspot.com/2012/04/bookmark-organizer-01-for-windows-phone.html) and [here](http://nullfactory.blogspot.com/2012/05/bookmark-organizer-02-with-skydrive.html)  

Although the popularity of the 7.x branch is on the decline, I hope someone would have use for it.

The project is now distributed via [Github](https://github.com/shanec-/Nullfactory.BookmarkSync). Enjoy!

I recently viewed the One Drive application statistics and was pleasantly surprised to find quite a number of users that have used it over the last two years.
