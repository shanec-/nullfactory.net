title: Ikman Classifieds Removed From Windows Phone Store

Alright, its time to remove my Ikman Classifieds app from the Windows Store. It should be finalized within the next couple of weeks. With less than a year of being in the store, I am happy with the way it turned out. What had originally stared out as a proof-of-concept for an html parse, ended up as a full fledged windows phone app. When I started working on app the ikman.lk did not have an exciting mobile experience, it was just a mobile site with exceptionally poor usability. I wanted to give myself a better mobile experience when using their site.

It took me about 3 months of "spare time" to get it ready for the windows store. This includes re-writing the entire parsing module a couple times, scrapping UI elements, adding last minute features. Yes, everything you would expect from developing a mobile app; which brings me to the experience. 

I learned a lot about UI, and specifically related to what works and what does not within the Windows Phone ecosystem.

* Html Agility Pack
* Reactive UI

I learned a great deal from the experience and hope that the official app fills the void that mine attempted to fill.


Here are some of the stats that I have of the application:


Yeah, the downloads are not terribly exciting, but if you take the fact that its targeted at the Sri Lankan audience and only to the percentage of Windows Phones owners, I think its not too bad. Also, I did not really put any effort in promoting it either.
