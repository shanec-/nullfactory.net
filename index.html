      <p class="post-date">09 May 2015

      <p>
		
		<p>I've been working on an multi-tenant solution recently and have been trying to come up with an efficient way to manage the database deployment and upgrade. The database is designed to segregate each tenant's data under its own schema namespace as such I need to generate a re-useable script that can be deployed against each tenant. The approach I am going to take is to first source control the database schema within a SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) database project and then use it to generate the script that can be parameterized with the tenant information.</p>

<p>I first parameterized the the schema name as a SQLCMD variable - <code>$TenantName</code>: </p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/DeploymentPlanModifer/10_varcmd.png" alt="SqlCmd Variable" /></p>

<p>Next I tried to replace the schema name with the new variable, but this did not work as trying to build the solution now returns with a 71502 error as the project is no longer able to resolve and validate schema objects.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/DeploymentPlanModifer/20_SchemaValidation.png" alt="Schema Validation" /></p>

<p>SQLCMD does not have any complaints if I replace the <code>[dbo].</code> with <code>[$TenantName]</code> in the generated script so its the SSDT project that is attempting to maintain the integrity of database. </p>

<p>One possible way to overcome this is to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10826014/suppress-some-warnings-in-sql-server-ssdt">suppress the 71502</a> by turning them into <a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/sqlserver/en-US/9b698de1-9f6d-4e51-8c73-93c57355e768/treat-specific-warning-as-error?forum=ssdt">warnings</a>. The disadvantage in this approach is that you loose the rich validation in exchange for something that is essentially a deployment convenience.</p>

<p>Another duct tape and bubble gum approach would be to just have some kind of post deployment operation that does a find and replace on the schema name. Sure it would work, but that's not going to be reliable in the long run. </p>

<p>A little bit of research reveals that the proper way to alter the creation of deployment script process is to create a deployment plan modifier. A deployment plan modifier is essentially a class that inherits <code>DeploymentPlanModifier</code> and allows you to inject custom actions when deploying a SQL project. There does not seem to be much formal documentation on the process, so I relied a lot on <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/dn306642(v=vs.103).aspx">this article in MSDN</a>, the sample <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/DACExtensions">DACExtensions</a> and what forum posts I could find. So with a lot of trial and error I wrote my own plan modifier that would replace the schema identifiers when the database project is published.</p>

		<p>If left unchecked, the SharePoint search service to attempts to consume most of the available memory in a resource constrained development box. I usually disable it when I am not actively working with it.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.falconitservices.com/support/KB/Lists/Posts/Post.aspx?ID=182">This seems to be most effective</a> way to completely disable the service. Although changing the password to an invalid one works as expected, it is important to replace the user account from a domain to a local user account as well. If not, the constant invalid login attempts could trigger your account lock out threshold policy in the domain.</p>

<p>So for convenience sake I created two batch files - one to disable the service and another to bring it back up.  </p>

		<p>User Account Control (UAC) is a security mechanism that is available in most modern versions of Windows. It restricts the ability to make changes to a computer environment without the explicit consent of an administrator. And as is with most production environments, it is very likely that this feature is already enabled. And just as likely, is the need to execute applications and commands under a different user within an elevated context during application deployment or maintenance. </p>

<p>This is achieved by using the <code>runas</code> command with the <code>/noprofile</code> flag. The command below creates an elevated command line running under the <code>wunder\admin</code> user:</p>

<pre><code>runas /noprofile /user:wunder\admin cmd 
</code></pre>

<p>Now, all commands executed within this new command prompt would be in the same elevated status.</p>

      <p class="post-date">05 Mar 2015

      | <a href="/category/security" title="Security">Security</a>
</p>

      <p>
		
		<p>Secure Socket Layer (SSL) is a security standard used to ensure secure communication between a web server and browser and used in most modern web application. As a developer it is prudent to setup your development environment to closely resemble production as much as possible, including security concerns. However, getting a full fledged CA SSL certificate for you development environment might not be the most cost-effective solution. Therefore post summarizes the steps I take to create a self signed wild card certificate to be used in the internal environments. My guide is based on this <a href="https://www.macaw.nl/weblog/2013/6/configuring-an-asp-net-project-for-development-with-ssl">excellent post</a>.</p>

<h2>Create the Certificate</h2>

<p>In order to create the certificate we would be using the <code>MakeCert.exe</code> tool which can be found at <code>C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\8.1\bin\x64\</code>. This command creates the certificate and adds it to the logged in user's personal certificate store:</p>

<pre><code>makecert -r -pe -e 01/01/2099 -eku 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1 -ss My -n CN="*.wunder.local" -sky exchange -sp "Microsoft RSA SChannel Cryptographic Provider" -sy 12 -len 2048 
</code></pre>

<p>Some of the notable flags:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>-r</strong> - Indicates that we're creating a self-signed certificate.</li>
<li><strong>-pe</strong> - Includes the private key in the certificate and makes it exportable.</li>
<li><strong>-e</strong> - The validity period of the certificate.</li>
<li><p><strong>-n</strong> - The subject's certificate name - specify the wildcard url. </p>

		<p>A while back I worked on a project that required me to integrate to a third-party web service. The web service also in development in parallel by the external team and our team was provided a development endpoint that would be used for testing. </p>

<p>The problem was the certificate used in the SSL was the same as the one production. This resulted in any call to the web service throwing an <code>Could not establish trust relationship for SSL/TLS secure channel</code> error because of the url mismatch. </p>

<p>Due to various constraints we were unable to get certificate replaced. So our temporary work around was to make our code to explicitly trust the external web service host:</p>

		<p>When SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) is deployed as an SharePoint integrated solution, it enables much of its functionality to be managed right from within SharePoint. Starting from the 2013 version, the integration between SharePoint and SQL Server Reporting Services 2012 is more tightly coupled than previous iterations. </p>

<p>One feature in integrated mode is the ability to have the data sources (.rsds) and report files (.rdl) within a document library itself. This means that reports can reference a DataSource within any document library in the SharePoint site. </p>

<p>In order for the report to work the user should have read permission on both the data source as well as the report file. The problem with this is that the same user can now potentially view the settings within the data source file, including the connection string.</p>

<h2>The Solution</h2>

<p>In order to protect the connection string, I came up with a solution to obscure it through encryption. The solution can be broken down to two major steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Force the reports to get the connection string by evaluating an expression embedded within itself. </li>
<li>Within this expression, call some custom code which manages the retrieval and decryption of the connection string. </li>
</ol>

<p>One of the limitations with this method is that you can no longer use a shared data source and each report has to have its credentials embedded.</p>

<p>In my example below, I will be retrieving the configuration string from a configuration list stored in the same SharePoint server. </p>

		<p>This post was inspired by a feedback provided by one of the commenters on <a href="http://www.edsquared.com/2011/02/12/Source+Server+And+Symbol+Server+Support+In+TFS+2010.aspx">this post</a>. The requirement was to exclude certain third party symbols from being published to the symbol server. I thought I would take upon the challenge to implement this.</p>

<p>As suggested in the same comment thread, my approach would revolve around explicitly setting the <code>FileList</code> property in the <code>PublishSymbols</code> activity. I would set it to a list that includes only the symbols that I want published. And the symbols I want to be excluded would be handled through a wild card filter that is passed as a build template parameter.</p>

<h2>Pre-Requisites</h2>

<ul>
<li>A properly configured symbol server. Check out my previous on <a href="/2015/01/setting-up-tfs-source-symbol-servers/">automatically publishing debug symbols</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Customization Steps</h2>

<p>My template is based on the default TFS template <code>TfvcTemplate.12.xaml</code> and customized with the following changes:</p>

		<p>Always make sure to disable the windows update services before starting any significant software upgrade. We found out the hard way that process such as a long running database backup does not handle kindly to spontaneous server restarts.</p>

<p>Its one of those thing that can easily slip through the cracks but have a large impact in your deployment. So always make sure to add this to part of your per-requisite checklist.</p>

<p>Personally I use the <code>net stop "windows update"</code> command as it is only effective until you restart the computer/service.</p>

		<p>Last month I worked on upgrading a Team Foundation Server from 2012.2 to 2013.4. While majority of the process was based on the off of the <a href="http://vsarupgradeguide.codeplex.com/">ALM Rangers upgrade guide</a>, there were a few interesting tidbits that we learned during the upgrade.  </p>

<p>The most important one was that Scheduled Backups feature no longer works if the services are stopped using the <code>TFSServiceControl quiesce</code> command.</p>

<p>While the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff470382.aspx">MSDN Article</a> for the command does state that it would take down all the services, it also says that you would normally use this command in order to facilitate backups. 
As such we assumed, incorrectly, that it would not apply to the scheduled backup service. </p>

		<h2>What are debug symbols?</h2>

<p>Debug symbols are artifacts that a debugger can use in order to better debug an application. Within the.NET ecosystem these are managed through PDB files. The PDB files contain information about the source file name, line numbers as well as local variable names.</p>

<p>As a software solution evolves, it is likely that multiple versions of it gets deployed into different production systems. And once the software is out in the wild, it becomes important that the developers can react to issues discovered by debugging specific versions. In order to do this effectively, it is important that the debug symbols themselves be treated as an first class artifact of the build and that it is readily accessible. Team Foundation Server (TFS) achieves this via a Source Server and Symbol Server.</p>

<h2>The Source Server and Symbol Server</h2>

<p>A Source Server component is essentially letting TFS know that we would be retrieving specific versions of source files and that it should be indexed. And a Symbol Server is a fancy name for a networked file share location containing the multiple versions of symbols <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jimlamb/archive/2009/06/15/symbol-and-source-server-in-tfs-2010.aspx">[read more]</a>.</p>

<p>A TFS build definition will be configured in order to automatically index sources and publish symbols <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/adamroot/archive/2009/06/17/source-server-and-symbol-server-features-in-team-foundation-server-2010-beta-1.aspx">[read more]</a>.</p>
